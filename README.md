# metaphorAndMindFinal
PsychoPy experiment for final project of the class Metaphor and Mind


This experiment is intended recreate Experiment 6 of _Casasanto, Boroditsky 2008_. Written in `Python3` and using the `PsychoPy` framework,
it presents a solid-line stimulus of a given length for a given duration of
time. The goal of the experiment is to examine the potential asymmetry of 
the affect of time on distance and vise versa. Such an asymmetry, ie that
our temporal perception is influenced by spacial information but not the other
way around, was the finding of the initial paper. This experiment hopes to 
re-examine this asymmetry, eg by changing the spacing of the duration and
distance values used.

TODO
- input the actual duration and distance values that will be used
- implement a function to write the recorded information to disk
- add a practice subroutine at the beginning of the program
- (?) include breaks in the experiment -- the user already decides when to 
begin a give trial
- (?) change the prompt telling whether the trial is temporal or spacial to
pictorial, rather than verbal
- (DONE) write the function that will record the user's response for time duration
- (DONE) write the function that will record the user's response for spacial distance
- (DONE) add a prompt to get user information at the beginning of the experiment

# Helpful Resources for Learning and Using PsychoPy

- [A helpful YouTube tutorial series about using PsychoPy for psych, 
and vision science specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=

- [PsychoPy resouce about dropped frames](http://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/detectingFrameDrops.html) 
Might be useful if there are troubles with timing.

- [PsychoPy home page](http://www.psychopy.org/)

- [PsychoPy page about _Coder_, the scripting side of PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/
coder/coder.html)
This is compared to _Builder_, PsychoPy's GUI for experiment creation. I 
only used _Coder_, but _Builder_ may be a useful tool as well, especially
for someone without much coding experience.

# Helpful Resources for Learning and Using PsychoPy

- [How to install PsychoPy](http://psychopy.org/installation.html) 
I just did the stand-alone download for the sake of ease of installation. If, 
however, you are going to spend a lot of time using PsychoPy it might be worth
getting just the Python library to work, as the editor in the stand-alone 
version is crap, and wouldn't be fun to work in long-term.

- [A helpful YouTube tutorial series about using PsychoPy for psych, 
and vision science specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KykNWxpCmRs&list=PLuqBA9VDSXk7Z06RtJ6Gh6Y5YznVrFrK6)

- [PsychoPy resouce about dropped frames](http://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/detectingFrameDrops.html) 
Might be useful if there are troubles with timing.

- [PsychoPy home page](http://www.psychopy.org/)

- [PsychoPy page about _Coder_, the scripting side of PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/coder/coder.html)
This is compared to _Builder_, PsychoPy's GUI for experiment creation. I 
only used _Coder_, but _Builder_ may be a useful tool as well, especially
for someone without much coding experience.
